# liatrio-cloud-infrastructure

## Hi there 👋
What is this org/team for?
This org/team provides the cloud-infra (on Azure) for all of the app dev things going on in our GHE demo. 
It also will provide all of the terraform modules, and other 🧙devops-y🧙 things that a central devops team might provide that the liatrio-cloud team doesn't!

🍿 time to build AKS clusters with GitOps & Terraform using reusable workflows! 

## Contribution guidelines
1. Don't be mean, seriously.
